## Survey

Surveys are the most frequently used customer feedback channel. They are one of the oldest as well. Easy to make and publish thanks to various tools available both free and paid. They are effective in a sense that you can send them to thousands of people with a click but the response rate is not really guaranteed.

## In-App Feedback

Giving users a way to send feedback while using the application is something that gives power back in the hand of the user. There is no need to put an incentive for such feedback. If implemented properly in-app feedback promotes both positive and negative constructive feedback equally.

At [gleaner](https://gleaner.in) we provide tools to craft beautiful web widgets for in-app feedback.

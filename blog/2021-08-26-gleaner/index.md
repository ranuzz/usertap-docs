## What is Gleaner ?

The simplest tool to gather in-app user feedback. A frictionless experience for users and a seamless experience for product developers. At gleaner we are creating beautiful widgets that embed anywhere in your web application and let your users provide feedback with just a tap without feeling a major UI/UX disruption.

## Why Gleaner ?

We believe that direct user feedback is one of strongest signal a product company can get. Sure, there are analytics, heatmaps and other indirect data gathering tools that give an overview of how users are interacting with the product but getting a direct constructive feedback reveals much more and avoids the need for interpretations. Current feedback tools require a lot of effort from users, which in turn incentivizes them to leave feedback only when something breaks. Our thinking is that we should aspire for positive feedbacks as well and know what works and make it even better. So we build gleaner which requires, in most cases, only a tap from the users. Our customisation lets you craft a widget that feels like your own product and prompts a question in front of the user in a non-intrusive manner.

## What does gleaner mean ?

Literal meaning of glean is to gather what is left behind after the harvest. At Gleaner we try to capture those user feedback that were left behind by other tools.
Gleaner doesn't replace your existing analytics and user feedback tools but works with them to give you additional data.

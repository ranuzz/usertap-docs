## Feedback

Any information you get as a reaction to your product which in turn you could use to improve your product is feedback. Analytics services, twitter following, instagram likes, youtube views .. everything gives a piece of information that can directly or indirectly help your product. There are various channels to get product feedback, here I'm listing some of the common ones.

## Surveys

Forms or questionnaires sent directly to customers or potential customers in hope to get a reply.

## Polls

Another form of survey but in a passive format that lets customers react quickly.

## Social Media

Public presence and content can be used to gather reaction from followers. It also becomes a place for users to interact with products directly.

## Chat

Engaging customers who land on your web page with a live agent chat.

## 1-on-1 Interviews

Inviting customers to have a more personal discussion about the product.

## In-App

Prompt users to let their voice heard while they are using the application.

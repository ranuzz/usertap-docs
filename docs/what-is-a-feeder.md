## Feeder

The visible widget that appears on your website and powered by [Gleaner](https://gleaner.in). It is the foundational element that starts the feedback journey for your consumers.

## Purpose

From a UI/UX perspective the purpose of feeder is to motivate consumers to leave more feedback. Just like an analytical service which tracks events in the background the feeder tracks explicit events that are triggered by the user in the foreground. These interactions or events answer the questions about product usage directly and don't need any more inference, unlike analytical services.

## Types

Primarily a web component a feeder can take any form or shape. Our library comes with predefined shapes with options to customise the look and feel. The placement of feeder is the main criteria with which we categorize them:

* FAB: Floating Action Button
* Sticky Bars
* Overlay
* Tooltip
* Quizzes/Polls
* Site Messages/Snackbar
* Forms
* Pop Ups
* Surveys

## Integration

Integrating feeders is a one time job. Once the library is imported in the web application with your unique `deployment ID`, you can customise the feeders any way you want on a live system without worrying about anything else.

At [Gleaner](https://gleaner.in) we provide NoCode tools to craft beautiful web widgets for in-app feedback. We want to motivate users to leave constructive feedback without restricting the way they consume your application.

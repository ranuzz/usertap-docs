## Types

Primarily a web component a feeder can take any form or shape. Our library comes with predefined shapes with options to customise the look and feel. The placement of feeder is the main criteria with which we categorize them:

* FAB: Floating Action Button
* Sticky Bars
* Overlay
* Tooltip
* Quizzes/Polls
* Site Messages/Snackbar
* Forms
* Pop Ups
* Surveys

At [Gleaner](https://gleaner.in) we provide NoCode tools to craft beautiful web widgets for in-app feedback. We want to motivate users to leave constructive feedback without restricting the way they consume your application.
